# FERSUM Engine

**FERSUM Engine Roleplay Stats Universal Maps Engine**

A python engine for developing custom or auto-generated interactive novels and text-based games with extreme depth and replayability.

The name is pronounced "Fearsome Engine" and is a recursive acronym made in honour of Iain M Banks. The first two letter of FERSUM in FERSUM Engine stand for 'FERSUM Engine'.

## Goals

 - Allow creators to quickly develop interactive experiences across any genre
 - Autogenerate large numbers of unique, deep, and narratively engaging experiences
 - Allow creators an intuitive way to set as few or as many parameters for the engine's output as they want
 - Plug in to an increasing number of other creation systems

## State of development

2022-06-14: Some loose proof-of-concept code not fit to create the Yarn story that inspired its creation.

## FAQ

### Can I get involved?

I'm not currently looking for help developing the engine. 

### Can I fork the repository and work on my own version?

Sure, but every game engine project on GitHub is further ahead than this and has a better way of doing things. You should try them first.

### What can the FERSUM Engine autogenerate?

Nothing right now. I still need to plug other projects I've progressed further before autogeneration is possible with FERSUM Engine.

### What are the first things the FERSUM Engine will be able to autogenerate?

I suspect Yarn 2 stories, Ramble-plot VA scripts, and basic TTRPG adventure modules will be the first things the engine will be capable of autogenerating.

### Why autogeneration?

Because I'm lazy, I'm fascinated by it, I crave surprise, and I want to keep the lower-bounds of the skill required to be considered a content-creator higher than what we can create with a single command-line input. Though mainly because I'm lazy.

### What inspired the FERSUM Engine?

I once made the comment that I could write better 'Yandere' YouTube Voice Actor content with a Python script than most young writers could write. This is on the unofficial to-do list.

### What is your background as a developer? 

I've coded mainly AI/ML projects, bots, scrapers, economic analysis, media sifters, language processors, automation scripts, and some API work. I've only been coding for two, maybe three, years and besides the ubiquitous three (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I only have any experience with Python. Being a developer is about fifth on my list of 'professions that help define me'. I'm better knows as a writer, an economist, a producer, or a political staffer.
